To install Angular on your local system, you need the following: Node.js:Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js.Here’s the newest version in nodejs.org&#x2F;en:If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run node -v in a terminal window.12node -vv16.17.1 npm Package Manager:Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal window. Install the Angular CLI To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command: 1npm install -g @angular/cli Create a workspace and initial application You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace. To create a new workspace and initial starter app: 1. Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here: 1ng new my-app 2. The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key. The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes. The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run. Run the application The Angular CLI includes a server, for you to build and serve your app locally. Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app. Run the following command: 12cd my-appng serve --open The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files. The –open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/. If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a page similar to the following. Compile and Package Angular CLI also provides commands: 1ng build --prod Among them, the parameter –prod tells the compilation environment to compile for the production environment package. Similarly, in the ‘angular.json’ file, default compilation parameters are defined, and if necessary, they can be modified. The main configuration parameters are as follows. 123456789101112131415&quot;configurations&quot;: &#123; ... &quot;budgets&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;initial&quot;, &quot;maximumWarning&quot;: &quot;5mb&quot;, &quot;maximumError&quot;: &quot;10mb&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anyComponentStyle&quot;, &quot;maximumWarning&quot;: &quot;1mb&quot;, &quot;maximumError&quot;: &quot;4mb&quot; &#125; ],&#125; Angular, by default, compiles to the ‘dist’ directory under the root directory, generating pure static files (html, css, js), as well as image files.

Here’s an example: you have a file named math.go containing a simple mathematical function ‘Add.’ Then, you will create a test file named math_test.go to test this function. Assuming the math.go file is as follows: 1234567// math.gopackage mainfunc Add(a, b int) int &#123; return a + b&#125; You can then create a math_test.go file to write your test code: 12345678910111213// math_test.gopackage mainimport &quot;testing&quot;func TestAdd(t *testing.T) &#123; result := Add(2, 3) expected := 5 if result != expected &#123; t.Errorf(&quot;Add(2, 3) returned %d, expected %d&quot;, result, expected) &#125;&#125; In math_test.go, we import the testing package and write a test function named TestAdd. Test functions should start with ‘Test’ and accept a *testing.T parameter, which is used to report test failures. Inside the TestAdd function, we call Add(2, 3) to execute the function being tested and compare the result to the expected value. If the result doesn’t match the expected value, we use t.Errorf to report the test failure with detailed error information. Next, you can run the tests using the ‘go test‘ command in your terminal: 1go test Go will search for all the _test.go files in the current directory and execute the test functions within them. If the tests pass, you’ll see a success message. If the tests fail, you’ll get detailed failure information. This is just a very basic example.

Below, I will provide examples of the usage and differences between these two concepts: Closure Example:A closure refers to a function that captures one or more variables from its outer function scope and can be called outside of that function while still accessing these captured variables. 123456789101112131415161718192021package mainimport &quot;fmt&quot;func main() &#123; outerVar := 10 // Closure function closure := func() &#123; fmt.Println(&quot;Outer variable outerVar:&quot;, outerVar) &#125; // Call the closure function closure() // Output: Outer variable outerVar: 10 // Modify the outer variable outerVar = 20 // Call the closure function again closure() // Output: Outer variable outerVar: 20&#125; In the above example, closure is a closure that captures the outer variable outerVar and can access and modify that variable even outside the function. Anonymous Function Example: An anonymous function is a function without a name; it can be directly assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to other functions. 1234567891011121314151617181920package mainimport &quot;fmt&quot;func main() &#123; // Define and call an anonymous function result := func(x, y int) int &#123; return x + y &#125;(5, 3) fmt.Println(&quot;Result of the anonymous function:&quot;, result) // Output: Result of the anonymous function: 8 // Assign an anonymous function to a variable add := func(x, y int) int &#123; return x + y &#125; sum := add(10, 20) fmt.Println(&quot;Calling the anonymous function using a variable:&quot;, sum) // Output: Calling the anonymous function using a variable: 30&#125; In the above example, we define an anonymous function and call it directly. We also assign another anonymous function to the add variable and use that variable to call the function. To summarize the differences: A closure is a function that captures external variables and can access and modify them outside of the function.An anonymous function is a function without a name, which can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to other functions.It’s important to note that while closures often involve anonymous functions, not all anonymous functions are closures. A closure is a specific type of anonymous function that captures external variables.","categories":[{"name":"Go","slug":"Go","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/"},{"name":"Closure and Anonymous Function","slug":"Go/Closure-and-Anonymous-Function","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/Closure-and-Anonymous-Function/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"A Brief Summary of \"go func()\"","slug":"goFunc","date":"2018-11-17T04:00:34.000Z","updated":"2023-10-17T15:38:25.992Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/11/16/goFunc/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2018/11/16/goFunc/","excerpt":"","text":"“go func()” is a way in the Go programming language to launch new concurrent goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread in Go used for concurrent task execution. Using “go func()” allows you to create new concurrent execution flows in your program without the need to explicitly create threads or manage the complexity of thread management. Here is a basic example and some key concepts of using “go func()”: Basic Example: 1234567func main() &#123; go func() &#123; // Place the code you want to execute in a new concurrent goroutine here &#125;() // The main goroutine continues to execute other work&#125; In the example above, “go func()” starts a concurrent goroutine for an anonymous function, which will execute the code inside it. The main goroutine continues to execute other tasks, while the new concurrent goroutine runs in the background. Key Concepts: Anonymous Function: Anonymous functions are typically used to define “go func()” because there’s no need to name the concurrent goroutine. The code for the anonymous function can be enclosed in {} as needed. Concurrent Execution: Goroutines launched with “go func()” run concurrently in the background without blocking the main program’s execution. This allows you to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving program performance. Data Sharing: Concurrent goroutines can share data, but it’s important to handle shared data carefully to avoid race conditions and data races. You can use tools provided by the “sync” package to manage access to shared data. Goroutine Management: Go’s runtime system is responsible for creating, scheduling, and destroying goroutines. You don’t need to worry about the complexity of thread creation and destruction. Waiting for Goroutines to Complete: If you need to wait for concurrent goroutines to finish, you can use mechanisms like “sync.WaitGroup” or channels to implement waiting. Using “go func()” is a simple way to achieve concurrency in the Go programming language, allowing you to run tasks in parallel, such as handling concurrent requests, performing background tasks, or other work that needs to execute simultaneously. However, be cautious about handling concurrency issues and ensuring that shared data is synchronized and accessed correctly.","categories":[{"name":"Go","slug":"Go","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/"},{"name":"go func()","slug":"Go/go-func","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/go-func/"}],"tags":[{"name":"go","slug":"go","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/go/"}]},{"title":"Union Sql Injection Detection Methods","slug":"UnionSqlInjection","date":"2016-10-24T23:11:44.000Z","updated":"2023-10-18T23:46:14.237Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/24/UnionSqlInjection/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2016/10/24/UnionSqlInjection/","excerpt":"","text":"Union Sql Injection Detection Methods First, check for the existence of an SQL injection vulnerability.

It serves as an interface for querying metadata information in MySQL. This information is stored in tabular form within tables in the “information_schema” database, and users can retrieve metadata information by using SQL statements to query these tables. Here are some common tables in the ‘information_schema’ database: SCHEMATA: Stores information about all databases, including database names, character sets, etc. TABLES: Stores information about all tables, including table names, table types, engines, etc. COLUMNS: Stores information about all columns, including column names, column data types, column constraints, etc. STATISTICS: Stores information about all indexes, including index names, index types, the table where the index is located, index columns, etc. USER_PRIVILEGES: Stores information about user privileges, including user accounts, permissions, etc. By querying the tables in the information_schema database, you can obtain information about various aspects of databases, tables, columns, indexes, users, and permissions. This is very helpful for database management and maintenance. Next, let’s take a look at an example of finding key information through the information_schema database: Query information about the current user:1SELECT current_user(); Query information about the user for the current session:1SELECT session_user(); Get the path of the database:1SELECT @@datadir; Get the installation path of MySQL:1select @@basedir; Retrieve information about the operating system version:1SELECT @@version_compile_os;","categories":[{"name":"Penetration Test","slug":"Penetration-Test","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/"},{"name":"MySQL","slug":"Penetration-Test/MySQL","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/MySQL/"},{"name":"About information_schema","slug":"Penetration-Test/MySQL/About-information-schema","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/MySQL/About-information-schema/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"In Qt, how to transmit custom data using QAction::setData","slug":"QtSetData","date":"2010-05-02T03:16:09.000Z","updated":"2023-10-17T16:04:32.083Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/05/01/QtSetData/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2010/05/01/QtSetData/","excerpt":"","text":"Recently, in a project, there was a need to transmit custom data using QAction::setData.
